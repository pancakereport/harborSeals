Silas - These are my notes from a few years ago.  Please:

1. Please look up the MARSS package for guidance
2. I added two .R files to your code folder with some of the code for the presentation I showed you for 1997 - 2017. 
The files are essentially copies of the MARRS vignette (link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MARSS/vignettes/UserGuide.pdf) 
chapters 8 and 9 (used to be chapters 7 and 8), hence my file names.
3. You could try to updated this code or start from scratch, up to you. I recall that I didn't get all of the Ch8 file to run.

Thanks!

BREEDING SEASON EMPHASIS

1. population trends 
   overall and by site
   
2. get survivorship (NO GOOD)
      year on year adult + pup

3. get fecundity = 
      pups/adults 
      assume 50:50 sex ratio
         = so pups/(0.5*adults)
         but males in water more during peak pupping season.  check with sarah.....

4. What number of surveys needed for monitoring?
   top_n with regressions
      compare estimates of population growth
      
5. Covariates on fecundity, pups, etc.
   ENSO
  
   double cpoint crash in 2016 with slides and coyote
   how much move to other colonies?
   
   phenology cline by site?
   
   if lose 2 big centers what happens to PORE colony?
   
   check with Codde on coyotes
   
6. MARRS
make files with top count of year for 
  1) adults, 
  2) pups
  3) adults + pups

H1: DP+DE+BL vs TB+TP
H2: all independent  (basic models show this is lowest AIC by far)
H3: Estuary vs Coast
      DE+BL+TB vs. DP + TP
don't count DUX, PB, or PRH
WELL, maybe count PRH and 
   
 -> how include ENSO covariate
 -> how code inverse relationship between sites withing a hypothesized group?  B-matrix, but performs poorly in converging.
   
   OTHER IDEAS FOR MARRS
   weigh station of 3 small sites during molt?
   
COMPARE: PORE Breed and Molt VS NMFS Molt 
  plots and population parameters.
  
  
7. basic MARRS file show that 5 independent pops are most parsimoniuos
next going with GAMMS for pops over time and MEI index

8. fix plots
report MARSS
report GLMMs including pup/adult
report rstanarm models


2021-09-20
TO DO
1. update plots to ggplot
2. get MEI to run
3. Solve linear plotting issue for best model

2021-10-08
Quick git update on bb computer test




2024-01-12
Hypotheses for adult-molt time series  1982 present
1. one adult pop vs one molt pop   
  A. (use for calculating overall regional trends for molts and adults)
2. one all stages pop
3. 12 individual pops
  A. include coyote
  B. Use to understand impacts of coyotes on sites.
4. North, South, and Bolinas pop
  A. can sum coyote for Drakes and DP ?


5. Perhaps build models with all years data from 1997 on?  then go back to the older data for just molt and adult?


2024-01-16

1. Growth rate by time
2. insert lag effect for PDO from previous fall (embryo implant) --> 2024-05 --> using Upwelling instead from previous spring)
3. add coyote leg effect from previous year or cumulative years with coyotes = 3 year sum of presence/abselce 
4. add 2003 eseal to coyote disturbance(with and without)  (ADDED to PRESENT = 1)
5. Make sure future pop growth not too optimistic
6. NOAA appreciates if molt helps predict breeding season - measures how in sync
7. corr plot    
  A. group sites close together --> BL, DE, DP and TP, TB            ####STARTED 2024-02-06
    i. can include or exclude PRH try both ways
  C. include DR and PB in model if BL, DE, DP, TP, TB over time vs DR, PN, PRH
  D. 


2024-05-26
1. adding general UI Mar_MAY for 39N, including lag  - use as main covariate.
2. Model plan
